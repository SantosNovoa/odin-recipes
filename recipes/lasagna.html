    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="" />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has
        ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta
        cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If
        using all beef, add Â¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian
        seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian
        sausage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce
        (it's easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned
        tomatoes if you'd prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao's for
        flavor.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Making Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the
        recipe below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain
        well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few
        minutes to thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna
        noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
