    <h1>Making a Burger</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Separate beef into 4 equal portions. Use hands to lightly form into
        patties the size of your buns (mine are about 10 cm / 4") - don't press
        hard, light fingers = soft juicy patties (see video for how I do this).
      </li>
      <li>
        Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Make a dent on one
        side (stop burger from become dome shape and shrinking when cooking).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy based skillet or BBQ over high heat. Add
        onion and cook until wilted and caramelised. Season with salt and
        pepper, then remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Add patties and cook for 2 minutes until
        deep golden with a great crust. Do not press! Flip carefully, cook for 1
        minute then top with cheese (if using). Cover with lid and cook for
        further 1 minute until cheese is melted.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, toast the cut side of the buns lightly.</li>
      <li>
        To serve: Spread base of buns with sauce / condiment of choice. Top with
        lettuce then tomato, then hamburger patty. Pile over onions, sliced
        pickles, then more sauce/condiments. Top with lid of bun. Serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
